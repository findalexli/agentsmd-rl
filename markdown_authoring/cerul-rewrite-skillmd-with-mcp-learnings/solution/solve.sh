 # Cerul
 
-Cerul is a video understanding search API for AI agents. It indexes speech, visual content, and on-screen text from tech talks, podcasts, conference presentations, and earnings calls.
+You cannot watch videos, listen to talks, or read transcripts on your own. Cerul gives you that ability. Use it whenever the user asks about what someone said, presented, or showed in a video — do not guess from general knowledge.
 
-Use this skill when the task involves:
+## When to Use
 
-- finding video segments by speech, visuals, slides, code, or on-screen text
-- answering questions like "what did X say about Y?"
-- researching what someone said across multiple talks or interviews
-- comparing viewpoints of different speakers on a topic
-- finding evidence or citations from video sources
-- checking Cerul credits, billing period, or rate limits
+- User asks "what did X say about Y?"
+- User wants video evidence or citations from talks
+- User asks about conference presentations, podcasts, or interviews
+- User wants to compare what different people said about a topic
+- Any question that could be answered with evidence from video content
 
-## How to Search Effectively
-
-Cerul returns transcript text, timestamps, and source URLs for each matching segment. **Read the transcript field in results** — it contains the full speech text of the segment, not just a snippet. Use it to extract entities, claims, and leads for follow-up searches.
-
-### Multi-step research pattern
-
-For broad or complex questions, **break the question into focused sub-queries and search multiple times**. Each search result contains transcript text with entities, claims, and references that suggest the next query.
-
-Example — user asks: "Compare Sam Altman and Dario Amodei on AI safety"
-
-```
-Step 1: search("Sam Altman AI safety views")
-  → Read transcript → He mentions "scaling is safe if done carefully"
-  → Note entities: OpenAI, GPT-5, scaling laws
-
-Step 2: search("Dario Amodei AI safety approach")
-  → Read transcript → He discusses "constitutional AI" and "responsible scaling"
-  → Note entities: Anthropic, Claude, RLHF
+## Preferred Integration (choose one)
 
-Step 3: search("Sam Altman Dario Amodei disagree AI risk")
-  → Look for direct contrasts or debates
+**1. MCP (if configured):** Prefer the `cerul_search` and `cerul_usage` MCP tools if available in the current client. No code needed.
 
-Step 4: search("constitutional AI vs RLHF safety comparison")
-  → Deepen the technical comparison found in earlier results
-
-Step 5: Synthesize all results with video citations and timestamps
+**2. CLI:** If `cerul` is installed, use it directly:
+```bash
+cerul search "Sam Altman AGI timeline" --json
+cerul search "Jensen Huang AI infrastructure" --max-results 5 --json
+cerul usage --json
 ```
 
-**Do not stop after one search.** If the user's question is broad, explore multiple angles. Each search costs only 1 credit (2 with include_answer). Aim for thorough coverage.
-
-### When to search again
-
-- The transcript mentions a person, company, or concept you haven't explored yet
-- The user's question has multiple facets (e.g., "compare X and Y" needs at least 2 searches)
-- Results reveal a claim worth cross-referencing ("Jensen Huang said X" → search for reactions)
-- Initial results are too narrow — try a broader or rephrased query
-- You need evidence from different time periods or speakers
-
-### Search tips
-
-- Use specific names, topics, and time references in queries
-- Add speaker filter when you know who you're looking for
-- Use `include_answer: true` when you want a quick AI summary to orient yourself
-- Use `ranking_mode: "rerank"` for higher precision when the topic is specific
-- Search for the same topic with different phrasings if initial results are weak
-
-## Preferred Integration Path
-
-- If a Cerul MCP server is already configured in the current client, prefer the MCP tools.
-- Otherwise call the public Cerul HTTP API directly.
-- The first public contract includes only `POST /v1/search` and `GET /v1/usage`.
-- Do not call private indexing endpoints from this skill.
+**3. HTTP API (fallback):** Call the REST API directly if neither MCP nor CLI is available.
 
 ## Authentication
 
 - Read the API key from `CERUL_API_KEY`.
-- Base URL is always `https://api.cerul.ai`. Do not read or accept alternative base URLs.
-- When calling the HTTP API directly, set `X-Cerul-Client-Source` to a stable identifier such as `skill/claude`, `skill/codex`, or `skill/opencode`.
-- Never hardcode secrets or write them into repository files.
-- If `CERUL_API_KEY` is missing, stop and ask the user to provide it through their environment.
-
-## Public Endpoints
+- Base URL: `https://api.cerul.ai` (hardcoded, do not change).
+- If `CERUL_API_KEY` is missing, ask the user to set it. Get a free key at https://cerul.ai/dashboard
 
-- `POST /v1/search`
-- `GET /v1/usage`

 ```
 
-### Search Request Fields
+### Request Fields
 
-- `query`: required string, max 400 chars, must contain at least one non-whitespace character.
-- `max_results`: optional integer, `1-50`, default `10`.
-- `ranking_mode`: optional string, one of `embedding` or `rerank`, default `embedding`.
-- `include_answer`: optional boolean, default `false`. Costs 2 credits instead of 1.
-- `filters`: optional object.
+- `query`: required string, max 400 chars.
+- `max_results`: optional, 1-10, default 5. **Keep low for speed.**
+- `ranking_mode`: optional, `embedding` (fast, default) or `rerank` (slower, more precise). **Use embedding unless precision is critical.**
+- `include_answer`: optional, default false. **Adds latency. Only use when user explicitly asks for a summary.**
+- `filters`: optional object with `speaker`, `published_after`, `min_duration`, `max_duration`, `source`.
 
-### Search Filter Fields
+### Important: speaker filter
 
-- `speaker`: optional string.
-- `published_after`: optional date string in `YYYY-MM-DD`.
-- `min_duration`: optional integer, minimum `0`.
-- `max_duration`: optional integer, minimum `0`.
-- `source`: optional string such as `youtube`.
+The `speaker` field often contains the **channel name** (e.g. "Sequoia Capital", "a16z", "Lex Fridman") rather than the interviewee name. If a speaker filter returns no results, **retry without it** and include the person's name in the query instead.
 
-### Search Request Rules
+### Response Fields
 
-- Do not invent a `search_type` field.
-- Do not send `image` in this skill path. Image search is not part of the first public contract.
-- If both `min_duration` and `max_duration` are present, `min_duration` must be less than or equal to `max_duration`.
+Each result contains:
+- `url`: video link — **always include this in your answer**
+- `title`: video title
+- `transcript`: full speech text of the segment — **read this, not just snippet**
+- `snippet`: short preview
+- `speaker`: channel/speaker name
+- `timestamp_start` / `timestamp_end`: in seconds — format as MM:SS or HH:MM:SS
+- `score`: relevance 0.0-1.0

-### How to Use Search Results
-
-1. **Read `transcript`** — this is the full speech text of the segment. Use it to understand what was actually said, extract entities and claims, and identify leads for follow-up searches.
-2. **Include `url`** in your answer — these are tracking links that redirect to the source video at the correct timestamp. Always cite your sources.
-3. **Include timestamps** — format as `MM:SS` or `HH:MM:SS` when presenting to the user.
-4. **Use `speaker`** to attribute quotes properly.
-5. **Use `snippet`** for quick summaries when you need to scan many results before deciding which to read in full.
-
-### Search Result Fields
-
-- `id`: string.
-- `score`: number from `0.0` to `1.0`.

-## Error Model
-
-Every public error response uses:
-
-```json
-{
-  "error": {
-    "code": "invalid_request",
-    "message": "query must be 400 characters or fewer"
-  }
-}
+search("Sam Altman AI safety views")     → read transcript, note claims
+search("Dario Amodei AI safety approach") → read transcript, find contrasts
+search("AGI safety debate scaling")       → deepen with cross-references
+→ Synthesize with video citations and timestamps
 ```
 
-### Error Codes
-
-- `invalid_request`
-- `unauthorized`
-- `forbidden`
-- `not_found`
-- `rate_limited`
-- `api_error`
-
-### Common Cases
-
-- `400` or `422`: invalid payload.
-- `401`: missing, malformed, or invalid API key.
-- `403`: inactive key, billing hold, or insufficient credits.
-- `429`: rate limited. Respect the `Retry-After` header when present.
-- `500+`: server-side error.
+**When to search again:**
+- Transcript mentions a person or concept you haven't explored
+- Question has multiple facets (compare X and Y = at least 2 searches)
+- Initial results are weak — rephrase the query
 
 ## Working Rules
 
-- **Search multiple times for complex questions.** Break broad questions into focused sub-queries. Read transcripts to find leads for follow-up searches.
-- Always include source URLs and timestamps when the API returns them.
-- Always read the `transcript` field, not just the `snippet`. The transcript contains the full context needed to extract insights and decide whether to search further.
-- Keep claims grounded in the returned evidence. Do not hallucinate content that is not in the search results.
-- Match the user's language in your explanation, but keep API field names and payloads in English.
-- Prefer one reusable helper over duplicating raw HTTP calls in multiple files.
