+# Codex Agent Instructions
+
+This repository is split into a backend API and a frontend React
+application.  Everything is containerised via `docker-compose` for local
+development.
+
+## Project structure
+
+- `backend/` – Node.js/Express API. Uses MongoDB and PostgreSQL and has
+  its own Jest test suite.
+- `frontend/` – React application bootstrapped with `react-scripts`.
+- `docs/` – Detailed architecture and development docs.
+- `docker-compose.yml` – Spins up the full stack locally.
+- `package.json` in the repo root – exposes lint scripts that call into
+  each package.
+
+## Architecture overview
+
+Commonly follows a client–server model. The backend exposes a REST API
+with Socket.io for real-time features. Data is stored in MongoDB (general
+app data) and PostgreSQL (chat). The frontend communicates with the API
+and renders the user interface using React and Material-UI. See the
+documents in `docs/` for full details.
+
+## Running tests
+
+- **Backend**: run `npm test` from the `backend` directory.
+- **Frontend**: run `npm test` from the `frontend` directory.
+
+## Running lint
+
+Run `npm lint` from the repository root. This invokes the lint scripts for both backend and frontend.
+
+## Workflow
+
+When modifying code in either package:
+1. Run `npm lint` at the repo root.
+2. Run `npm test` in the affected package(s).
+
+These commands require no additional setup other than installing dependencies (already included in the repository).
