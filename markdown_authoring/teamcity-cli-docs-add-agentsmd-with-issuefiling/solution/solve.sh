+# Agent Instructions
+
+## Filing Issues
+
+- **Always check `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` before creating an issue.** This repo has
+  `blank_issues_enabled: false` — every issue must use a template. Match the template
+  to the issue type (bug, feature, eval task).
+- **Follow the template structure exactly.** Fill in each section as defined in the YAML
+  fields. Do not add extra sections, root-cause analysis, or fix suggestions unless the
+  template asks for them.
+- **Verify labels exist before using them.** Templates declare labels (e.g. `eval`) that
+  may not yet exist in the repo. Run `gh label list` first; create missing labels only
+  if the template requires them.
+
+## Eval Issues (`eval_task.yml`)
+
+Eval issues document real agent failures to turn into automated benchmarks. Keep them
+focused on observable behavior:
+
+- **Prompt**: what the agent was asked to do
+- **What the agent did**: paste the actual commands and reasoning — no interpretation
+- **Correct behavior**: numbered list of concrete steps / assertions
+- **Failure type checkboxes**: select from the predefined list only
