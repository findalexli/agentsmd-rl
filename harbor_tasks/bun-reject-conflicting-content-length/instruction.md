# Reject conflicting duplicate `Content-Length` headers in `bun-uws`

The HTTP request parser in `packages/bun-uws/src/HttpParser.h` is exposed to a
**HTTP request-smuggling** vulnerability: it accepts requests that carry
multiple `Content-Length` header fields whose values disagree, and it accepts
requests where one of those `Content-Length` fields has an empty value. Both
cases are explicitly forbidden by RFC 9112 §6.3 and RFC 9110 §8.6, because the
parser must not be allowed to disagree with downstream proxies / clients about
where one request ends and the next begins.

You need to harden the parser so that a single, well-defined Content-Length
value is the only thing the rest of the parser ever sees.

## Behavior the parser must implement

For each parsed request, after the headers have been read but before
`Content-Length` is interpreted as a body length:

1. **No Content-Length headers** — accept (unchanged behavior).

2. **Exactly one Content-Length header** — accept it (unchanged behavior).

3. **Multiple Content-Length headers, all with the same value** — accept the
   request and treat the value as if a single header had been sent. RFC 9112
   §6.3 explicitly permits this case.

4. **Multiple Content-Length headers with at least one differing value** —
   reject the request with HTTP `400 Bad Request` and the parser-level error
   code `HTTP_PARSER_ERROR_INVALID_CONTENT_LENGTH`. The check must be
   byte-for-byte: `"5"` and `"05"` count as different. Ordering of the
   headers must not matter.

5. **A `Content-Length` header whose value is the empty string** — reject the
   request with HTTP `400 Bad Request` and parser-level error
   `HTTP_PARSER_ERROR_INVALID_CONTENT_LENGTH`. This case must be rejected
   *even if* a later, well-formed `Content-Length` header would otherwise
   make the request unambiguous, because accepting the empty value first
   would let an attacker smuggle a second request inside the body that the
   real Content-Length header advertises.

The pre-existing rejection of "Transfer-Encoding **and** Content-Length on the
same request" must continue to hold.

## Where the bug lives

The HTTP request parser in `packages/bun-uws/src/HttpParser.h` currently
accepts requests with multiple `Content-Length` headers without validating
that all values agree, and it accepts requests where a `Content-Length`
header has an empty value. In both cases the parser makes a body-length
decision based on incomplete information, which creates a request-smuggling
vulnerability. This is the only file you need to modify for this task.

The validation logic runs after the request line and all headers have been
parsed. At that point the full set of headers that were present in the
incoming request is available. You need to add a check that detects and
rejects the ambiguous `Content-Length` cases described in the behavior
specification above.

## How your fix will be evaluated

The graders compile a small C++ driver that links against your modified
`HttpParser.h` and feeds it raw HTTP byte streams. A passing fix:

- returns `HttpParserResult::error(HTTP_ERROR_400_BAD_REQUEST, HTTP_PARSER_ERROR_INVALID_CONTENT_LENGTH)`
  for a request with `Content-Length: 6` followed by `Content-Length: 5`,
- returns the same error for a request whose first `Content-Length` value is
  empty and whose second `Content-Length` advertises a body containing a
  smuggled `GET /admin HTTP/1.1` request,
- accepts a request with two identical `Content-Length: 5` headers and
  delivers exactly one request callback with the body `Hello`,
- accepts a request with a single `Content-Length` header (the common case)
  and one with no `Content-Length` at all,
- accepts a chunked `Transfer-Encoding` request that has no `Content-Length`,
- continues to reject a request that carries both `Transfer-Encoding:
  chunked` and `Content-Length: 5`.

The code must continue to compile cleanly under `g++ -std=c++20 -Wall`.

## Constraints

- Your change must live in `packages/bun-uws/src/HttpParser.h`. No other file
  in the repo should be modified to fix this issue.
- Do not change the public signature of `consumePostPadded` /
  `fenceAndConsumePostPadded` or the layout of `HttpRequest` /
  `HttpParserResult`.
- Follow the surrounding C++ style of the file: 4-space indentation, brace
  on the same line as `if`/`for`, RFC-citation block comments, and use the
  existing `HttpParserResult::error(...)` factory rather than constructing
  results inline.

## Code Style Requirements

- The grader compiles your change with `g++ -std=c++20 -Wall` (a few low-noise
  warning categories — `unused-parameter`, `unused-variable` — are silenced
  because they fire on parts of `HttpParser.h` that you should not be
  modifying). Your change must produce no new warnings under those flags.
- Match the existing formatting in `HttpParser.h`: 4-space indentation, no
  tabs, `if (...)` (not `if(...)`), and an opening brace on the same line as
  the control statement.
