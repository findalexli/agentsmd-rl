# Simplify eslint-plugin-react-hooks preset configurations for v7.0.0

## Problem

The `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` package currently exposes too many configuration presets, creating confusion for users. There are five named configs (`recommended`, `recommended-legacy`, `recommended-latest-legacy`, `flat/recommended`, `recommended-latest`) plus their flat equivalents, many of which exist only for backwards compatibility with older ESLint or plugin versions.

Additionally, the `recommended` preset only enables the two basic hooks rules (`rules-of-hooks` and `exhaustive-deps`) but does not include the React Compiler rules, which should now be on by default.

## Expected Behavior

Slim down to just 2 configuration presets:

- **`recommended`**: includes ALL recommended rules (both basic hooks rules AND compiler rules) — the tests verify this by checking that this config maps to the variable containing the complete set of rule configurations
- **`recommended-latest`**: same as recommended plus any bleeding-edge experimental compiler rules

The removed presets (`recommended-legacy`, `recommended-latest-legacy`, `flat/recommended`) and their flat config equivalents should be deleted entirely from `packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/index.ts`.

The plugin's `meta` object should also include a `version` field with a semver string in the format `version: 'X.Y.Z'` (e.g., `version: '7.0.0'`).

The package.json version field must be updated to `7.0.0` or higher.

After making the code changes, update the package's README to reflect the simplified configuration. The README should have two main configuration sections with these exact headers:
- `## Flat Config` — for users of ESLint's flat config format (eslint.config.js)
- `## Legacy Config` — for users of traditional .eslintrc format

The custom configuration examples in the README should also be updated to show the full set of available rules including compiler rules (e.g., `rules-of-hooks`, `exhaustive-deps`, `config`, `error-boundaries`, `component-hook-factories`, `gating`, `globals`, `immutability`, `preserve-manual-memoization`, `purity`, `refs`, `set-state-in-effect`, `set-state-in-render`, `static-components`, `unsupported-syntax`, `use-memo`, `incompatible-library`).

The README currently has version-specific installation sections (for different ESLint/plugin versions) that are no longer needed — these should be consolidated into clean, simple instructions.

Add a `## 7.0.0` entry to the CHANGELOG documenting the breaking change.

## Files to Look At

- `packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/index.ts` — plugin entry point with config definitions
- `packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/README.md` — installation and usage documentation; must contain `## Flat Config` and `## Legacy Config` section headers
- `packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/CHANGELOG.md` — add a 7.0.0 entry for the breaking change
- `packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/package.json` — version field (must be >= 7.0.0)
- `ReactVersions.js` — central version registry
- `fixtures/eslint-v6/.eslintrc.json`, `fixtures/eslint-v7/.eslintrc.json`, `fixtures/eslint-v8/.eslintrc.json` — update preset references

## Verification

The tests verify:
- The 'recommended' config maps to the variable containing all rule configurations (including compiler rules)
- The legacy configs ('recommended-legacy', 'recommended-latest-legacy', 'flat/recommended') are removed from the configs object
- The plugin meta object includes a version field with semver format
- The package.json version is >= 7.0.0
- The repo is at the expected git commit containing '9724e3e'
