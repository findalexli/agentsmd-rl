+  Prognostic assessment workflow: trend analysis, degradation onset detection,

+  server. Use this skill when the user says "trend analysis", "degradation trend",
+  "RUL", "remaining useful life", "prognosis", "prognostics", "failure prediction",
+  "time to failure", "degradation onset", "predict failure", "vita utile residua",
+  "previsione guasto", "quanto dura", "stima vita", or asks to predict when a
+  component will fail based on vibration data.

+
+# Prognostic Assessment (ISO 13374 Block 5)
+
+Estimate degradation trends and remaining useful life from vibration signals.
+Orchestrate MCP tools in a precise prognostic sequence.
+
+**Prerequisite**: The `predictive-maintenance-mcp` MCP server must be connected.
+
+## Workflow
+
+### Step 1 — Signal Discovery
+
+Call `list_stored_signals()` to check cached signals, or `list_signals()` to
+browse the data/ directory. Identify the signal file to analyze.
+
+The prognostics tools segment a single signal file internally, extracting a
+feature series over time from consecutive segments. This works best on
+run-to-failure recordings or long monitoring sessions where degradation
+evolves within the signal.
+
+### Step 2 — Trend Analysis
+
+Call `analyze_signal_trend(signal_file=..., feature_name="rms")`.
+
+The tool automatically segments the signal, extracts the chosen feature per
+segment, and fits a linear trend.
+
+Parameters:
+- `feature_name`: degradation indicator — `"rms"` (default), `"kurtosis"`,
+  `"crest_factor"`, `"peak_to_peak"`, etc.
+- `sampling_rate`: auto-detected from metadata if not provided
+- `segment_duration`: segment length in seconds (default: 0.1s)
+- `overlap_ratio`: overlap between segments (default: 0.5)
+
+Good feature candidates:
+
+| Indicator | Use when | Notes |
+|-----------|----------|-------|
+| rms | General degradation | Most common, ISO 20816 aligned |
+| kurtosis | Bearing degradation | Peaks early, then may drop |
+| crest_factor | Impulsive faults | Sensitive to early damage |
+| peak_to_peak | Looseness, imbalance | Good for mechanical looseness |
+
+Ask the user which indicator to track, or default to **rms** if unsure.
+
+Interpretation:
+
+| R-squared | Trend direction | Meaning |
+|-----------|----------------|---------|
+| > 0.7 | Increasing | Strong degradation trend |
+| 0.3 - 0.7 | Increasing | Moderate trend, monitor closely |
+| < 0.3 | Any | No clear trend (or non-linear) |
+| Any | Decreasing | Improving or post-maintenance |
+| Any | Stable | Stationary condition |
+
+**Decision gate**: If trend_direction is "stable" or "decreasing", report that
+no degradation trend is detected. Ask if the user wants to proceed with RUL
+estimation anyway.
+
+### Step 3 — Degradation Onset Detection
+
+Call `detect_signal_degradation_onset(signal_file=..., feature_name="rms", threshold_sigma=3.0)`.
+
+- Default threshold: 3 sigma (99.7% confidence)
+- Lower to 2.0 for more sensitive detection (may trigger false positives)
+
+If onset is detected, report:
+- At which segment the degradation began (`onset_segment_index`)
+- How many total segments were analyzed
+
+### Step 4 — RUL Estimation
+
+Call `estimate_rul(signal_file=..., failure_threshold=..., method="linear")`.
+
+**Choosing the failure threshold**:
+- If ISO 20816 zone C/D boundary is known, use it (e.g., 4.5 mm/s RMS for
+  Group 2 rigid machines)
+- If the user has a maintenance policy threshold, use that
+- If unknown, ask the user — do NOT guess
+
+**Choosing sampling_interval**:
+- Defines the time unit of the returned RUL
+- Default 1.0 means RUL is expressed in "segments"
+- Adjust based on what the user needs (e.g., set to actual time between
+  segments for real time units)
+
+**Choosing method**:
+- `"linear"` — simpler, works for steady degradation (default)
+- `"exponential"` — for accelerating degradation curves
+- `"weibull"` — Weibull distribution fit (if available)
+- `"kalman"` — Kalman filter estimation (if available)
+- Compare linear and exponential if unsure — the one with higher confidence
+  (R-squared) is typically more appropriate
+
+If RUL is infinity or confidence is 0, the curve doesn't reach the threshold.
+Explain why and suggest:
+- The threshold may be too high for the current trend
+- Try the other method
+- The signal may not show sufficient degradation
+
+### Step 5 — Interpretation and Recommendations
+
+Combine all findings into a concise prognostic summary:
+
+1. **Trend**: direction, strength (R-squared), slope, feature analyzed
+2. **Onset**: which segment degradation started (if detected)
+3. **RUL**: estimated time to failure with confidence
+4. **Urgency**: based on RUL vs. next planned maintenance window
+
+Recommended actions based on RUL:
+
+| RUL | Urgency | Recommendation |
+|-----|---------|----------------|
+| < 1 interval | Critical | Immediate inspection/replacement |
+| 1-3 intervals | High | Schedule maintenance soon |
+| 3-10 intervals | Moderate | Monitor more frequently |
+| > 10 intervals | Low | Continue routine monitoring |
+
+## Important Notes
+
+- RUL estimates are **extrapolations** — actual failure time depends on
+  operating conditions that may change
+- Always use cautious language: "estimated RUL", "projected failure time"
+- Confidence (R-squared) below 0.5 means the estimate is unreliable
+- This tool augments expert decision-making; it does not replace engineering
+  judgment for maintenance scheduling
+- All processing happens locally — raw signal data never leaves the machine
