+
+## 1. Project Overview and Architecture
+
+Topograph discovers the physical network topology of a cluster (NVLink domains, InfiniBand/Ethernet switch fabric, cloud rack topology) and exposes it to workload schedulers — Slurm, Kubernetes, and Slurm-on-Kubernetes (Slinky). It has five runtime components:
+
+- **API Server** — receives `/v1/generate` requests, aggregates bursts, dispatches to a Provider
+- **Node Observer** — Kubernetes-only; watches node status changes and triggers regeneration
+- **Node Data Broker** — Kubernetes-only DaemonSet; collects per-node attributes (NVLink clique IDs, etc.) as node annotations
+- **Provider** — per-environment adapter that queries a topology source (CSP API, NetQ, `ibnetdiscover`, DRA labels) and returns a canonical representation
+- **Engine** — per-scheduler translator that writes the canonical representation out as `topology.conf`, Kubernetes node labels, or a Slinky ConfigMap
+
+### Key invariant
+
+Providers differ by environment. The canonical `*topology.Vertex` tree is stable. Engines only translate — they do not discover.
+
+This separation is load-bearing. If you find yourself reading the fabric in an engine, or emitting scheduler-specific output from a provider, stop and reconsider.

+### Do not change without discussion
+
+These structures propagate across every provider and engine. Changing them in a single PR usually means the PR is too broad.
+
+| Surface | Why it's load-bearing |
+|---|---|
+| `pkg/topology/` — the `Vertex` tree and topology constants | Every provider returns it; every engine consumes it. A shape change ripples to all of them. |
+| `protos/topology.proto` | Used by `forwardServiceUrl` gRPC forwarding. Breaking changes require regeneration (`make proto`) and coordinated client updates. |
+| Helm `global.provider.name` / `global.engine.name` / `topologyNodeLabels` | External contract for operators deploying Topograph. |
+| The four default label keys `network.topology.nvidia.com/{accelerator,leaf,spine,core}` | Consumed by downstream projects (KAI Scheduler, NVSentinel, Kueue). |
+
+## 2. Setup and Installation
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+- **Go 1.24.7** (see `go.mod`) — newer minor versions are fine; older will not build
+- **make**
+- **golangci-lint** — `brew install golangci-lint` or via `go install`
+- **docker** — only for container image builds and the IB variant
+- **protoc** + plugins — only when regenerating protobuf (`make init-proto` installs the plugins)
+
+### Clone and build
+
+```bash
+git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/topograph.git
+cd topograph
+make build   # produces bin/topograph, bin/node-observer, bin/node-data-broker-initc
+```
+
+Cross-compile with `make build-linux-amd64`, `make build-darwin-arm64`, etc.
+
+### Protobuf regeneration
+
+Only when `protos/*.proto` changes:
+
+```bash
+make init-proto   # one-time: installs protoc-gen-go and protoc-gen-go-grpc
+make proto        # regenerates pkg/protos/*.pb.go
+```
+
+Commit the regenerated files alongside the `.proto` change.
+
+## 3. Testing and Deployment Workflows
+
+### Local test loop
+
+```bash
+make qualify  # runs fmt, vet, lint, and test in sequence — pre-push aggregator
+make fmt      # go fmt ./...
+make vet      # go vet ./...
+make lint     # golangci-lint run (only flags new issues vs. main)
+make test     # go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
+make coverage # human-readable per-package summary
+```
+
+Run `make qualify` before pushing. The individual targets are available if you want to run a single check during iteration.
+
+### Coverage policy
+
+From `codecov.yml`:
+- **Project coverage**: 60% target, 5% threshold for drops
+- **Patch coverage**: 50% target, 5% threshold
+
+Coverage checks run on pull requests. A drop below target with no matching uplift in the touched files will fail the Codecov check.
+
+### CI workflows
+
+- `.github/workflows/go.yml` — build, test, lint on every push and PR
+- `.github/workflows/docker.yml` — container image build (manual trigger)
+- `.github/workflows/docker-ib.yml` — InfiniBand-variant container (manual trigger)
+- `.github/workflows/helm-release.yaml` — Helm chart release (manual trigger)
+
+### Deployment surfaces
+
+- **Binaries** — `deb` and `rpm` packages via `make deb` / `make rpm` (consumed by Slurm users)
+- **Container images** — `ghcr.io/nvidia/topograph` (consumed by Kubernetes users)
+- **Helm chart** — `charts/topograph/` (with `node-data-broker` subchart)
+
+## 4. Coding Style and Conventions
+
+### Formatting and linting
+
+- `go fmt ./...` is authoritative — do not hand-format
+- `golangci-lint` runs in CI with `--new-from-rev` so only new issues block; fix warnings in code you touch
+- Copyright header on every new Go file: `Copyright (c) <year>, NVIDIA CORPORATION.  All rights reserved.` followed by the Apache 2.0 boilerplate matching existing files
+
+### Provider interface
+
+The contract lives in `pkg/providers/providers.go`:
+
+```go
+type Provider interface {
+    GenerateTopologyConfig(
+        ctx context.Context,
+        pageSize *int,
+        instances []topology.ComputeInstances,
+    ) (*topology.Vertex, *httperr.Error)
+}
+```
+
+A provider returns the root `*topology.Vertex` of the discovered tree. Leaf vertices are compute nodes; interior vertices are switches or (for block topology) accelerator domains. Return `*httperr.Error` so the API server can propagate the correct HTTP status code — plain `error` is not acceptable at this boundary.
+
+### Adding a new provider
+
+1. Create `pkg/providers/<name>/` with at minimum `provider.go` and `provider_test.go`
+2. Expose a `NamedLoader` function with signature `func NamedLoader() (string, providers.Loader)` — this is how the registry wires the provider
+3. Register in `pkg/registry/registry.go` by adding `<name>.NamedLoader` to the `providers.NewRegistry(...)` call list
+4. Add `docs/providers/<name>.md` following the shape of `aws.md` / `netq.md` (prerequisites, credentials, parameters, how it works, verification)
+5. Update `README.md` — the "Currently supported providers" list and the "Choosing a Provider" scenario table
+6. If the provider has a simulated variant for testing, export a second `NamedLoaderSim` and register it alongside (see `aws`, `gcp`, `oci`, `lambdai`)
+
+### Adding a new engine
+
+Engines are much rarer (three exist: slurm, k8s, slinky). Follow the same registry pattern but register in `engines.NewRegistry(...)`. Coordinate with maintainers before starting — adding an engine implies a new output format that every provider's output must be translatable into.
+
+### Anti-patterns
+
+| Don't | Because |
+|---|---|
+| Read the fabric inside an engine | Engines only translate; discovery belongs in providers |
+| Emit scheduler-specific output from a provider | Same invariant in reverse |
+| Change `pkg/topology/Vertex` fields without discussion | Every provider and engine depends on the shape |
+| Hand-edit `pkg/protos/*.pb.go` | These are regenerated by `make proto`; edit `protos/*.proto` instead |
+| Add a new provider in `pkg/providers/<name>/` without also updating `pkg/registry/registry.go` and `README.md` | Orphaned code; provider will not be loadable |
+| Skip DCO sign-off to "fix later" | The DCO bot will block the PR; rebase with `--signoff` is always available |
+| Use plain `error` at the provider interface boundary | Must be `*httperr.Error` so the API server returns the correct HTTP status |
+
+### Label and annotation reference
+
+Label keys written by the Kubernetes and Slinky engines are documented in `docs/reference/node-labels.md`. Do not invent new keys in provider or engine code — values flow through the canonical tree; keys are configured via Helm `topologyNodeLabels`.
+
+## 5. Pull Request Guidelines
+
+### Branch naming
+
+Use a prefix that matches the change type: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`, `test/`. Example: `docs/agents-md`, `feat/crusoe-provider`.
+
+### Commit messages
+
+Conventional Commits format:
+
+```
+type(scope): short description
+
+optional body
+
+Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
+```
+
+Type must be one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `style`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`.
+
+### DCO sign-off is required
+
+Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by:` trailer. There is no `.github/dco.yml` exemption on this repo — NVIDIA org membership does not bypass the DCO bot here. Two ways to add it:
+
+```bash
+git commit -s -m "feat(provider/foo): add Foo provider"        # adds trailer
+git commit -s -S -m "..."                                       # sign-off + GPG sign
+```
+
+If a PR arrives without sign-off, rebase the branch to add it:
+
+```bash
+git rebase --signoff upstream/main
+git push --force-with-lease
+```
+
+### GPG signing is optional but recommended
+
+Configure once:
+```bash
+git config --global user.signingkey <key-id>
+git config --global commit.gpgsign true
+```
+
+Signed commits get a **Verified** badge on GitHub. The GPG public key must be uploaded to your GitHub account.
+
+### Pre-push checklist
+
+- [ ] `make qualify` passes (runs fmt, vet, lint, test)
+- [ ] New or changed public behavior is covered by a test
+- [ ] Provider changes update `docs/providers/<name>.md` and `README.md` if the scenario table or provider list is affected
+- [ ] Engine changes update `docs/engines/<engine>.md`
+- [ ] `pkg/topology/` or `protos/` changes were discussed in an issue first
+- [ ] Every commit has a DCO sign-off
+
+### Review expectations
+
+- All CI checks must be green before merge (Go build/test/lint, Codecov, DCO)
+- Reviewers look for: adherence to the provider/engine boundary, test coverage on new code paths, doc updates when contract changes
+- Breaking changes to the config schema, label keys, or `Vertex` shape are rejected unless discussed in an issue first
+
+### When in doubt
+
+Read `docs/` before asking. Provider-specific questions usually have answers in `docs/providers/<name>.md`. Label semantics are in `docs/reference/node-labels.md`. The scenario-to-provider mapping is in the "Choosing a Provider" table in `README.md`.
